# Phonebook Prgoram

## To create a phonebook program that:

- [ ] Load a phonebook file
- [ ] User can create new contact, {name: number}.
- [ ] User can search for a name or number in the phonebook file
- [ ] Entire Codebase flow is modular, reusable and optimized
- [ ] A particular Algorithm is Identified and used with huge consideration to code efficiency.

## What can be learnt

1. Define a function
2. Create an multi-line input function
3. Print in multi-line strings format
4. Close a function

## Concepts used

1. Multiple line strings format
2. Input and print Functions
3. Data Structures: Dictionary and dictionary methods(create empty dictionary, delete and update an item)
4. User-defined Functions
5. Control Flow statements(Iterative, Conditional and Transfer statement(break, return))

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function to welcome the user and provide options on how the phonebook works.
   - [x] Define a function named 'welcome'
   - [x] Create a variable using the input function and multi-line strings format inside the function.
   - [x] Close the function
2. Define the main function "phonebook"
   - [x] Initiate a function name "phonebook"
   - [x] Initiate an empty 'contact' dictionary to store values, inside the phonebook function block.
3. Initiate a loop inside the function to continuously run the phonebook program.
   - [x] Initiate a while loop to continuously run the phonebook program
   
4. Call 'welcome' function. Set the entry variable to welcome function.
   - [x] Set entry variable to welcome function
5. Create conditions for decision-making, for any option entered by the user.
   - [ ] For the first entry, check if the contact dictionary is initially empty. If it is not empty, print the current contact list in the phonebook
   - [ ] Otherwise, inform the user that the Phonebook is empty.
6. Create decision-making for the second entry
7. Create a decision for third entry
8. Create a decision for the fourth entry
9. Create a decision for the fifth entry. Break the program and exit.
10. If entered entry is not an "entry" variable, display an error message.
11. üöÄ PROGRAM COMPLETE.
